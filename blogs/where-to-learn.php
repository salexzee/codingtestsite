			<h1>Where to learn</h1>

			<?php include("../inc/ads.php"); ?>
			
			<p>When learning how to code, weather it be HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, etc, there are a lot of places to learn. In this post, I'll go over some of the resources I've used in my past few months of learning and give you a basic rundown of what I think.</p>
			
			<h3><a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a></h3>
			<p>This is probably the first place people go when they want to learn something. I went here first, because I didn't know any other resources that I could try to learn from. One of the big things that makes YouTube a good place to learn is that it's free. Not just free to you as the person watching videos, but also free to the people who want to post tutorials and get exposure.</p>
			
			<p>While that's a good thing, it's also a bad thing at the same time. With the fact that anyone is allowed to post videos to YouTube for free, it makes it to where there is a lot of bad advice floating out there. It's hard, as a newbie, to filter through the good advice and the bad. I'm not suggesting that you don't use YouTube, I still use it to this day to learn small things quickly.</p> 
			
			<p>My suggestion is to use YouTube to quickly learn the basics of a language, but once you get into more advanced stages, probably use a resource that is specialized in coding and make sure you read the actual documentation on any specific language you plan to learn.</p>
			
			<h3><a href="http://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a></h3>
			<p>Codecademy is another good resource to use when learning to code. The lessons are good for beginners and they help you advance your skills. Also, you learn by doing. They have a great in browser text editor and you can see exactly what your code is doing as you write it. With these lessons, they can take you from complete beginner, a fairly decent designer and developer. They also have back end lessons. I have yet to check out those lessons, but if they're as good	as their front-end lessons, they should be great. At some point, I'll go back and check out their back-end lessons and give some reviews about them.</p>
			
			<h3><a href="http://referrals.trhou.se/samuelwebb">Team Treehouse</a></h3>
			<p>I'll just start this off by saying Treehouse is currently my favorite place to learn web design and development. Their lessons are quite in-depth and they can take you from beginner to advanced in a matter of months. They teach you with video lessons and they also have a great text editor to follow along with the lessons. Their lessons cover a variety of technologies and they have an ever growing library. For a beginner, the only downfall would be that it costs to use this service and I can understand not wanting to pony up your hard earned cash for a service you don't know will work for you. The remedy to that is to do the 2 free weeks they offer.</p>
			
			<p>Also, with their forums, if you're having trouble with any lessons or even trouble with a project outside of the Treehouse website, there are a lot of other students who are willing to help you out, as well as the moderators and teachers. I would highly recommend this website to anyone who is new to coding, as well as experienced coders who want to learn a new technology.</p>
			
			<p>There's a lot more to their website that I did not cover so to see the more in depth features and services they offer, make sure you head on over to the Team Treehouse website.</p>
