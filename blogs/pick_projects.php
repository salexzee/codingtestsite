<h1>How to Pick New Projects</h1>

<?php include("../inc/ads.php"); ?>

<p>For someone new to coding, people always say that the best way to retain information is to use what you've been learning on your own projects. What they don't tell you is how to go about choosing those projects. In this short post, I'm going to try to do that for you. I'm also fairly new to coding in the grand scheme of things and this is the list of things that I'm doing to help me build more projects. You don't need to incorporate all of these ideas, even just looking into one should be enough to start getting more projects in your portfolio.</p>

<h4>Discover a local need</h4>
<p>Most times, if you live in an area for an extended amount of time, you have an idea of a few local needs. I watched an interview with Nick Pettit (<a href="https://twitter.com/nickrp">@nickrp</a> on Twitter), a teacher at Team Treehouse, in which he discussed how he first got into coding. He then went into a story about when he was in college and he saw a bunch of job boards around the school. He decided to make an online job board, because he saw the need for an easier and more efficient method to post jobs as an employer and find jobs as a potential employee. This is what I mean by, "Discover a local need."</p>
<p>There are tons of projects like this for you to do. The best part about this is that you can do what you want with these. Since there's no hard deadline, make sure you take your time and show it to a few friends for feedback. This will make your project better in the end and it will also force you to learn things you may not have thought about trying to learn yet.</p>

<h4>Figure out what people like</h4>
<p>Basically, make sure you have a life. Go out and have fun. See what's around your area that you enjoy and that other people enjoy. As an example, let's say you're the kind of person who enjoys going out to the clubs. You've been to all of them in town multiple times. You know which nights they have their specials and you always know when there's going to be an event. Why not make an application that puts out that information? One consolidated place that talks about all the clubs in your area, rates them(based on your users ratings) and promotes upcoming events.</p>
<p>That's just one idea. There are tons more for you to look into and make a web application about. Maybe hiking trails or scenic views. There are so many things out there that people like.</p>

<h4>Look for local websites</h4>
<p>Before I dig into this one, I'd firstly like to say, I don't recommend doing websites for businesses free of charge. This website is going to help them make money(this is the goal) and they should be willing to pay you for your services.</p>
<p>Now, back to this. What are some local stores you like to shop at? What about a local bar you like to relax at? What about a local charity in the area? Look for these online and check out their website. How's it look? Can you do a better job? Are there any features you can add to improve it? Do they even have a website? These are all questions you can ask yourself and try to take action on. Maybe propose a redesign of the website and if they don't have one, propose you be the person to create it for them. Remember, at this point you're talking to a business owner so you need to have solid reasons why they need you to update their website. A business is all about making money, so make sure your ideas and suggestions reflect that goal.</p>

<h4>What are you good at?</h4>
<p>We're all good at something. What is something you're good at? What's something you enjoy and you can talk about for ages? Got it? Ok now do that. Talk about it. Make a blog about it. Add your knowledge to the giant knowledge bank that is the internet. Got a brother, sister, friends, parents? What are they good at? You can make a blog for them as well. You could even make a Content Managemtent System(CMS) to make it easier for them to add their blog posts. You'll get more experience and have yet another thing for your portfolio.</p>

<h4>What do you want to be good at?</h4>
<p>Lastly, what are some things you'd like to learn or be better at doing? This one is very similar to the previous section. Again, make a blog about it. Say you want to learn to play guitar. Make a blog where you show people the progress you're making, while also giving tips about what's helping you learn. What do you think this blog is for me? This blog goes in this catagory. I learned some PHP and Bootstrap and I wanted to use those skills. Then CodingTestSite was born.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Now obviously there are a lot more projects than I mentioned in this blog post and there are a ton more ways to think about how you'd start a new side project. This list is how I think of new projects and hopefully this will help get you on the road of making something great.</p>
