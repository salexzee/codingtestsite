	<h1>5 Amazing Websites</h1>

    <?php include("../inc/ads.php"); ?>

    <h3>I've put together a list of 5 really amazing websites. These are some of my favorites and by the time you get to the end of this list, you'll be eager to brush up on your CSS skills.</h3>

    <h2><a href="http://www.ro.me">5: Ro.Me</a></h2>
    <p>This website is what's described as an "interactive film." Basically what that means is your mouse movements affect the camera as the film plays out. It's a great use of Javascript and by the end your creative juices should be flowing. View this website using Google Chrome for the best experience. Check it out here: <a href="http://www.ro.me">Ro.Me</a></p>

    <h2><a href="http://www.georgeandjonathan.com/#2">4: GeorgeAndJonathan.Com</a></h2>
    <p>This is the website for the music of, you guessed it, George and Jonathon III. The detail that was put into this site is supurb, down to the cool mouse pointer when hovering over clickable items. It's hard to find any flaws in this website, because the more you look, the more enjoyable the experience is. Check it out here: <a href="http://www.georgeandjonathan.com/#2">GeorgeAndJonathan.Com</a></p>

    <h2><a href="http://www.lifeofpimovie.com">3: LifeOfPiMovie.Com</a></h2>
    <p>This one is a large website, but I'm just focusing on the landing page. This is the website for the Life of Pi movie and it's just as creative and imaginative as the movie is. I really enjoy the use of clips from the movie being used as the background. I feel that they blended everything together very well and if you haven't seen the movie yet, this website will make you want to watch it. Check it out here <a href="http://www.lifeofpimovie.com">LifeOfPiMovie.Com</a></p>

    <h2><a href="http://dreamandreach.bose.com">2: DreamAndReach.Bose.Com</a></h2>
    <p>There isn't much that I need to really say about this website besides the stating the fact that it's amazing. When you first visit it, you don't realize what you're about to experience. After the intro video, this website opens into a beautiful masterpiece. The use of parralax scrolling is supurb as well as all the hover affects you'll end up running into the more time you spend on this site. Check it out here: <a href="http://dreamandreach.bose.com">DreameAndReach.Bose.Com</a></p>

    <h2><a href="http://superherocheesecake.com">1: SuperHeroCheeseCake.Com</a></h2>
    <p>This is it, the big number 1. The execution of this site is just perfect. These artists have risen the bar with their epic portfolio site. At first glance, you just have a jumbotron at the top showing off their work. On second inspection, you realize that every time you slide over to the next project image, the entire website below changes to appeal to that specific project. There are so many more great things about this site, but I don't want to ruin it for you. Check it out for yourself: <a href="http://superherocheesecake.com">SuperHeroCheeseCake.Com</a></p>
