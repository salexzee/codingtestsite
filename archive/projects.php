			<h2>New projects</h2>
			<p>In this section is a list of all current projects I am working on.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="rpl.php">Rock Paper Lazers(RPL)</a>
					<p>This is a spin off of the basic Rock Paper Scissors game where
					Lazers takes the place of Scissors. It is a simple game that I
					learned how to build on <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>.
					The original Javascript coding for the game is quite simple, but I want
					to alter it a little bit to make it fit better with my website.
					I have recently made the game available and there will be multiple updates
					to provide a better user experience. You can navigate to the game via the
					navigation bar, or just click on the title of this post. Enjoy.</p>
