			<p>Hey coders, welcome to <span style="color:red">CodingTestSite</span>. Firstly,
			I'd like to thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you learn a thing or two
			from it. Oh I'm sorry, let me introduce myself. My name is Sam and I'm a
			Front-end Web Developer. This was the first website I created and now has come the
			time for an update.</p>
			<p>As some of you may already know, this website is dedicated to the experience of
			learning to code. So everything I learn, I will be testing out on this site, as well
			as writing blog posts to help teach aspiring coders the things I've learned and am
			currently learning about.</p>
