				<p class="lead col-xs-8">Hey, my name is Sam Webb and welcome to CodingTestSite. This is the place to be for up-to-date insight, tutorials and reviews on all things web design and web development. In the past few months I've done a lot of learning about quite a few different technologies and now I'd like to give back some of the information I've attained. Hope you learn a thing or two.</p>

				<p class=" col-xs-12">If you have any questions or would like me to write a post about anything in particular, please feel free to contact me. And if you'd like to see any of the projects I've worked on, you can find my portfolio at <a href="http://samwebb.me/portfolio.php">SamWebb</a>.</p>
