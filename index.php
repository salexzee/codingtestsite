			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>Hey coders, welcome to <span style="color:red">CodingTestSite</span>. Firstly, I'd like
			to thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you learn a thing or two from it. Oh I'm
			sorry, let me introduce myself. My name is Sam and I'm an amateur coder. I've always
			been interested in coding ever since I was young and now I've decided to make the big
			leap into actually becoming a coder. The reason I'm making this website is to have
			a place to practice different techniques that I learn in a public place.</p>
			
			<h2>My Skills</h2>
			<p>As of late, my HTML and CSS skills have been vastly improving. Also, just my overall
			knowledge about web standards and how the web works in general. I'm still around the same
			level of knowledge about Javascript that I had when I first created this page, because I
			started to focus on trying to perfect (or get as close to it) my HTML and CSS knowledge.
			One major thing I did was I ended up switching from <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>
			to <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>. Yes it's a paid service, but
			I've learned so much more and I would recommend them any day. If you want, you can check
			out my profile by clicking <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/samuelwebb">HERE</a>
