Hey you guys. This is just my website for me to try out new things I learn
while learning more and more about web development. This site is kind of
behind in terms of my knowledge since I stopped updating it for a while.
I'll be back on here coding away so keep a look out for all the upcoming
changes to be made. And trust me, there will be a ton. And I mean a ton.
