~THIS PROJECT~
I've decided to change what this website is about once again. When I first created it,
it was supposed to be a blog. I then changed it to be a site for me to text new coding
techniques and technologies that I learn. Now, I've decided to switch it back to being
a blog. I'm going to be doing this site in PHP with the obvious HTML, CSS and Javascript.
For Javascript, I'll be using mostly jQuery and on the CSS side I'll probably be testing
out some Bootstrap. I haven't used it before so I'll see how this goes. My goal with
this blog is to still use new things I learn to add to the site, so as was before, this
will be an ever changing project.

To view the files from before the changes, look in the 'archive' folder.
